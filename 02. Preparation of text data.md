# Data Preparation

Deep neural networks, including large language models (LLMs), cannot directly process raw text because it is categorical and incompatible with mathematical operations like matrix multiplication. To address this, text must be converted into continuous-valued vector representations through a process called embedding. Embeddings transform discrete tokens (words or subwords) into dense numerical vectors that capture semantic relationships, enabling neural networks to process and learn from text. Different data types (e.g., text, audio, video) require specialized embedding models. Techniques like tokenization (e.g., byte pair encoding) and positional encoding further refine these embeddings to preserve word order and context. This preprocessing step is essential for training models to understand and generate human-like text.

Several algorithms have been developed to create word embeddings, with **Word2Vec** being one of the earliest and most influential. Word2Vec trains a neural network to generate embeddings. The key insight is that words appearing in similar contexts share related meanings, allowing their embeddings to capture semantic relationships. While pretrained models like Word2Vec provide general-purpose embeddings, modern large language models (LLMs) typically generate their own embeddings as part of the input layer, which are fine-tuned during training. This approach offers a key advantage: embeddings are optimized specifically for the model's task and dataset, leading to better performance compared to static, pretrained embeddings like Word2Vec.  

Word embeddings can vary in dimensionality, ranging from just a few dimensions to thousands. Higher-dimensional embeddings (e.g., hundreds or thousands of features) can capture more nuanced semantic relationships between words, enabling models to discern subtle contextual differences. However, this increased expressiveness comes at a computational cost—larger embeddings require more memory and processing power, potentially slowing down training and inference. Lower-dimensional embeddings, while less precise, offer greater efficiency. The choice of dimensionality involves a trade-off: models like GPT-3 use high-dimensional embeddings (e.g., 12,288 dimensions) for advanced performance, whereas simpler applications may prioritize computational efficiency with smaller embeddings. Balancing expressiveness and efficiency is key in designing effective NLP systems.

##  Text Tokenization
Tokenization is the fundamental process of breaking down input text into smaller units called tokens, which serve as the basic building blocks for LLMs. These tokens can represent individual words, subwords, or special characters (including punctuation). Tokenization transforms raw text into a structured sequence that can be converted into numerical embeddings for model processing. For example, the sentence "Hello, world!" might be tokenized into ["Hello", ",", "world", "!"]. Effective tokenization is crucial. It balances granularity (preserving meaning) and efficiency (managing vocabulary size), with methods ranging from simple whitespace splitting to advanced algorithms like byte pair encoding (BPE) used in models like GPT. This preprocessing step directly impacts an LLM's ability to interpret and generate human-like text.
