Deep neural networks, including large language models (LLMs), cannot directly process raw text because it is categorical and incompatible with mathematical operations like matrix multiplication. To address this, text must be converted into continuous-valued vector representations through a process called embedding. Embeddings transform discrete tokens (words or subwords) into dense numerical vectors that capture semantic relationships, enabling neural networks to process and learn from text. Different data types (e.g., text, audio, video) require specialized embedding modelsâ€”text embeddings. Techniques like tokenization (e.g., byte pair encoding) and positional encoding further refine these embeddings to preserve word order and context. This preprocessing step is essential for training models to understand and generate human-like text.
