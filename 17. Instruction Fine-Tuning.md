# Instruction Fine-Tuning
This section introduces the core concept of instruction fine-tuning. Pretrained LLMs (like base GPT-2) are excellent at text completion but poor at instruction following:
* Can complete sentences: "The weather today is..." → "sunny and warm"
* Struggle with instructions: "Fix this grammar: 'He go to school'" → Often continues incorrectly

Instruction fine-tuning (also called supervised instruction fine-tuning) transforms a pretrained LLM into one that can:
* Understand specific instructions
* Generate appropriate responses (grammar correction, text transformation, Q&A, etc.)

**Supervised instruction fine-tuning follows three-stage process**  

**Stage 1: Dataset Preparation**
* Step 1: Download and format the instruction dataset
* Step 2: Organize data into training and target batches

**Stage 2: Model Setup & Fine-tuning**
* Step 3: Load a pretrained LLM
* Step 4: Fine-tune on instruction data

**Stage 3: Evaluation**
* Step 5: Extract and evaluate model responses
* Step 6: Quantify performance
