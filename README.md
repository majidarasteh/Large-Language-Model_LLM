# Large-Language-Model_LLM
ðŸš€ Welcome to the LLM (Large Language Models) Course Repository!
This repository contains materials, code examples, and resources for learning about Large Language Models (LLMs).

For the completion of this course, I used the following reference:  

* Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) by Sebastian Raschka.

This book provided a comprehensive, hands-on guide to understanding and implementing large language models from the ground up, covering essential topics such as tokenization, transformer architectures, training pipelines, and model optimization.
