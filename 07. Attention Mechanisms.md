# Attention Mechanism  
**RNNs** often fail to maintain long-range dependencies (like connecting distant but related words) and struggle with complex sentence structures. This limitation directly inspired **attention mechanisms**, which allow models to dynamically focus on all relevant parts of the inputâ€”solving the bottleneck and memory problems that plagued RNNs.

## RNN Limitations  
**RNNs** were once the go-to solution for language tasks like translation, but they had serious flaws. The main issue was how they handled information. Imagine trying to translate a sentence word by word while only remembering the last few words you saw - that's essentially how RNNs worked. They processed text sequentially, updating their "memory" (hidden state) at each step, but this created problems.

1. First, RNNs struggled with long sentences. Important connections between words far apart (like "cat" at the beginning and "was happy" at the end) often got lost in translation. The network's memory would fade over distance.
2. Second, the entire meaning of a sentence had to squeeze into a single final memory state before translation could even begin. This was like trying to summarize a whole book in one sentence before translating it - you'd inevitably lose crucial details.

These limitations made RNNs bad at handling the complex relationships in language. They motivated researchers to develop attention mechanisms, which let models look back at any part of the original sentence when needed, just like how humans naturally focus on different words when understanding meaning. This breakthrough led to today's much more powerful language models.

## Attention Mechanisms  

Self-attention enables every element in an input sequence to dynamically evaluate and incorporate information from all other elements in that same sequence. This "attention" mechanism determines how much focus each part of the sequence should give to every other part when creating its representation. As the foundational building block of transformer-based models like GPT, self-attention allows modern large language models to understand contextual relationships between all words in a text simultaneously, rather than processing them in isolation or in rigid sequence.

## Simple Self Attention Mechanism
The term "self" in self-attention highlights how this mechanism evaluates relationships within a single sequence. Unlike traditional attention that connects separate input/output sequences, self-attention examines internal connections - analyzing how each word relates to all others in the same sentence. Self attention key properties are as follow:
* Each position (like a word) dynamically determines its relationship to every other position
* Discovers how different elements influence each other (e.g., how verbs connect to their subjects)
* Operates entirely within one input sequence rather than between separate sequences
