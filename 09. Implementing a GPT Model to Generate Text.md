# Implementing a GPT Model to Generate Text
This section details the practical implementation of a GPT model from the ground up, focusing on the architectural components and mechanisms that enable it to generate coherent text. We will assemble the core elements, embedding layers, transformer blocks with self-attention and feed-forward networks, and output projections into a unified model capable of autoregressive prediction. By understanding how these pieces interconnect and forward-pass data, we lay the foundation for training and using the model to generate meaningful sequences token by token.

## GPT-2 vs. GPT-3: Key Differences and Practical Considerations   
This section clearly shows why GPT-2 is the practical choice for learning, experimentation, and implementation, while GPT-3 remains in the domain of well-resourced organizations with access to specialized computational infrastructure. GPT-3 maintains the same fundamental transformer architecture as GPT-2, using:
1. The same attention mechanism
2. Similar feed-forward network structure
3. Identical layer normalization approach
4. Comparable tokenization methods

**Scale Differences**  

The primary distinction lies in the massive scale increase:

## Layer Normalization in Deep Neural Networks  
In transformers like GPT, layer normalization is crucial for training stability across many layers, allowing effective learning of complex patterns without gradient issues. Layer Normalization stabilizes neural network training by standardizing the outputs (activations) of each layer to have:
* **Zero mean**: centered around 0. ($μ = 0$)
* **Unit variance**: spread of 1. ($σ^2 = 1$)

This addresses two critical problems in deep networks:
1. **Vanishing gradients:** Prevents gradients from becoming too small during backpropagation
2. **Exploding gradients:** Prevents gradients from becoming excessively large

**Benefits in Transformer Architectures**
1. **Training Stability:** Normalized activations prevent gradient issues
2. **Faster Convergence:** Models reach optimal solutions more quickly
3. **Consistent Learning:** Reliable training across different architectures
4. **Improved Generalization:** Better performance on unseen data

**This standardization process is mathematically represented as:**
* $LayerNorm(x) = (x - μ) / √(σ² + ε)$
* Where:
  * $x$ = input activation
  * $μ$ = mean of activations
  * $σ²$ = variance of activations
  * $ε$ = small constant (prevents division by zero)
* Operates on the last dimension: Typically the embedding dimension in transformers
* Uses epsilon ($ε$): A tiny constant (e.g., $1e-5$) added to prevent division by zero

**Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) and Batch Normalization (BatchNorm)**
Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) and Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) are both techniques to stabilize and accelerate neural network training, but they differ in how they normalize data.  

1. **Batch Normalization (BatchNorm)**
   * Normalizes across the batch dimension (for each feature, it computes mean/variance over all samples in the batch).
   * Requires large batches to compute reliable statistics.
   * Ideal for convolutional networks and tasks with fixed-size inputs (e.g., image classification).
     
2. **Layer Normalization (LayerNorm)**
   * Normalizes across the feature dimension (for each sample, it computes mean/variance across all features).
   * Independent of batch size — works even with batch size = 1.
   * Ideal for sequential data (e.g., NLP, transformers) and variable-length inputs.
  
**Example: The Scenario: Grading Students' Tests**  
Imagine we have a small class with 3 students, and they each took 4 exams. We can represent their scores in a table. In deep learning terms, this is a batch of 3 students (the batch size), each with 4 features (their scores).

<img width="602" height="184" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e49826f1-17b8-466d-a228-be4a264e5c47" />

* **Batch Normalization: "The Subject Expert":** looks at one subject at a time, across all students. It normalizes columns. It makes the distribution of scores for each subject consistent. For example, If a new student (Danny) comes in for just one test (a batch size of 1), the BatchNorm "expert" has no other students to compare him to.
* **Layer Normalization: "The Student Counselor":** LayerNorm looks at one student at a time, across all their subjects. It normalizes rows. It makes the distribution of scores for each student consistent. For example, If Danny comes in alone (batch size of 1), the LayerNorm "counselor" can still look at all his subjects, calculate his personal average and spread, and normalize his scores perfectly. It doesn't need other students.

## Implementing Feed-Forward Networks with GELU Activations
The dominance of the simple ReLU activation function has been challenged in the era of LLMs. To achieve higher performance, models now favor sophisticated alternatives like $GELU$ and $SwiGLU$. These functions introduce smooth, non-linear transitions (inspired by Gaussian and sigmoid gates, respectively) that are better suited for the complex patterns learned in deep language models. The GELU activation function can be implemented by the following function:  

<img width="692" height="74" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fe379a4-c331-45c1-8fdb-3738d76460c5" />

GELU's smooth gradient enables more precise parameter updates, facilitating better optimization than ReLU. Unlike ReLU's sharp, non-differentiable point at zero which can hinder training in deep networks. GELU produces small, non-zero outputs for negative inputs. This allows all neurons to contribute to learning, rather than having negative inputs be completely deactivated. The output of the $GELU$ and $ReLU$ can be as follow:

<img width="1100" height="388" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61eb693f-132f-42b2-8206-3c2992ab3ee2" />

The **FeedForward module** is vital for a model's learning and generalization. It first projects inputs into a higher-dimensional space (e.g., 4x wider $768 → 3072$), applies a non-linear $GELU$ activation, then projects back down to the original dimension. This allows the model to learn more complex, richer feature representations within each token's context. Crucially, maintaining identical input and output dimensions enables the seamless stacking of multiple transformer blocks, making the overall architecture scalable and modular.

## Shortcut (Skip/Residual) Connections
**Vanishing gradients is the core problem:** In deep neural networks, a critical problem emerges during training:
* Gradients (the signals that guide weight updates) become progressively weaker as they propagate backward through layers.
* This vanishing gradient phenomenon makes it difficult to effectively train earlier layers.
* As networks grow deeper, earlier layers receive negligible update signals, essentially stopping their learning process

**Solution: Shortcut Connections**  
Shortcut connections (also called skip or residual connections) address this problem through a simple but powerful mechanism:
1. **Creating an Information Highway:** They provide a direct path for gradients to flow backward through the network, bypassing one or more layers.
2. **Gradient Preservation:** During backpropagation, gradients can flow directly through the shortcut, preventing them from vanishing as they reach earlier layers.
3. **Mathematical Formulation** Instead of making a layer learn a complete transformation $H(x)$, we have it learn the residual (the difference):
   * The actual output becomes $H(x) = F(x) + x$
   * Instead of a layer learning $H(x)$, it learns the residual $F(x) = H(x) - x$
   * The network only needs to learn the difference or change needed

Without shortcut connections, training the deep architectures used in modern LLMs would be practically impossible due to the vanishing gradient problem. This simple but powerful innovation was crucial for the development of today's deep learning models.

A comparison between two five-layer deep neural networks: one without shortcut connections (left) and one with shortcut connections (right). These connections work by adding a layer’s input directly to its output, forming a bypass route that allows signals to skip one or more layers.

## Building the Transformer Block: Core of Modern LLMs
The transformer block is the fundamental repeating unit that gives models like GPT their remarkable capabilities. In GPT-2 Small, this identical block is stacked 12 times, each applying the same operations to progressively refine the representation of input tokens. Each transformer block intelligently combines several key innovations:
1. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**
   * Discovers and weights relationships between all tokens in the sequence
   * Multiple "heads" enable the model to focus on different types of relationships simultaneously
2. **Layer Normalization**
   * Applied before each major operation
   * Stabilizes training and ensures consistent activation distributions
3. **Feed-Forward Network with GELU**
   * Processes each token independently through an expand-contract pattern.
   * Uses GELU activation for smooth, non-linear transformations
   * Expansion (768→3072) → GELU activation → contraction (3072→768)
4. **Residual (Shortcut) Connections**
   * Added around both attention and feed-forward operations
   * Preserve gradient flow through the deep network
5. **Dropout Regularization**
   * Applied to attention weights and feed-forward outputs
   * Prevents overfitting and improves generalization

Imagine a processing unit that takes in token representations (768-dimensional vectors, where each row represents a token) and outputs transformed vectors of the exact same dimensions. This is the transformer block - a perfectly dimension-preserving component that can be stacked repeatedly to form deep language models.

## The GPT Model Architecture
The GPT architecture follows a sophisticated yet elegant pipeline where data flows through multiple processing stages:
1. **Input Processing Stage**
   * Tokenization: Text is split into subword tokens
   * Token Embedding: Each token is converted to a dense vector representation
     * 50,257 possible tokens → 768-dimensional vectors
   * Position Embedding: Position information is added to each token
     * 1,024 possible positions → 768-dimensional vectors
   * Combination: Token + position embeddings are summed together
     
2. **Core Processing Stage (Transformer Stack)**
   * Multiple Identical Blocks: The same transformer block repeated multiple times
     * GPT-2 Small: 12 layers (124 million parameters)
     * GPT-2 Medium: 24 layers (355 million parameters)
     * GPT-2 Large: 36 layers (774 million parameters)
     * GPT-2 XL: 48 layers (1.5 billion parameters)
   * Each Block Contains:
     * Multi-head self-attention
     * Feed-forward neural network
     * Layer normalization
     * Residual/skip connections
     * Dropout regularization
3. **Output Stage**
   * Final Normalization: LayerNorm applied to stabilize outputs
   * Vocabulary Projection: 768-dimensional vectors → 50,257 vocabulary scores
   * Probability Conversion: Scores converted to probabilities via softmax

**Progressive Refinement:**  
  * Early layers: Capture basic syntax, local patterns, and simple relationships
  * Middle layers: Understand semantic meaning and medium-range dependencies
  * Later layers: Develop complex reasoning, long-range dependencies, and nuanced understanding

**Parameter Distribution Example (GPT-2 Small)**  

This elegant yet powerful architecture enables GPT models to process language through deep, hierarchical feature extraction while maintaining training stability through careful architectural choices.

**The GPT model architecture (Stacking Transformer Blocks) is as follow:**

<img width="891" height="1047" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d751a9a3-3519-48e6-9a25-22a3accea234" />

## How GPT Generates Text: One Token at a Time
GPT models generate text through an iterative, autoregressive process. This means they predict one word (or token) at a time, and each new prediction is based on the growing sequence of all previously generated tokens.  

Imagine you give the model the starting prompt: "Hello, I am". Here is the step-by-step process it follows to complete the sentence:

<img width="545" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a93d347-6531-48df-bb2d-ad213f8466f3" />

1. **The Initial Input**
   * The starting text, **"Hello, I am"**, is converted into a sequence of numerical token IDs using the model's tokenizer. This sequence is fed into the model.
   
2. **Getting the Raw Output (Logits)**
   * The model processes this input and outputs a 3D tensor of logits. The shape is $[batch_size, num_tokens, vocab_size]$.
   * For our single input, batch_size is 1
   * num_tokens is 3 (for "Hello", "I", "am").
   * vocab_size is 50,257 (the number of tokens the model knows).
   * This tensor contains a 50,257-dimensional vector of scores for each input token, representing how likely every possible word in the vocabulary is to come next.
     
3. **Focusing on the Next Token**
   * We only care about the prediction for the **very last token** in the sequence. Why? Because the model's job is to predict what comes **after** the entire sequence so far. We extract the score vector corresponding to the position after "am".

4. **Converting Scores to Probabilities**
   * The large vector of scores (logits) is passed through a softmax function.
   * This converts the scores into a proper probability distribution, where every value is between 0 and 1, and all values add up to 1.
   * Now we have the model's estimated probability for every single token in its vocabulary being the next correct token.
  
5. **Selecting the Next Token**
   * A decision must be made on which token to choose from this probability distribution. The simplest method is greedy decoding: always selecting the token with the absolute highest probability (e.g., the word "a").
   * In practice, more creative methods like $top-k$ is used. These randomly select from a shortlist of the most likely tokens, which introduces randomness and leads to more diverse and interesting outputs.
  
6. **Appending and Repeating**
   * The chosen token ID (e.g., for "a") is appended to the original input sequence.
   * The input for the next step is now ["Hello", "I", "am", "a"].
   * This new, longer sequence is fed back into the model, and the entire process repeats.
   * The model now predicts what comes after "Hello, I am a" (let's say it picks "model").

7. **Converting Tokens to Text**
   * Once we have finished generating (e.g., after a set number of tokens or when an "end-of-text" token is produced), the final sequence of token IDs is converted back into human-readable text using the tokenizer's decoder. The result is a coherent sentence: "Hello, I am a model ready to help."
