# Implementing a GPT Model to Generate Text

## GPT-2 vs. GPT-3: Key Differences and Practical Considerations   
This section clearly shows why GPT-2 is the practical choice for learning, experimentation, and implementation, while GPT-3 remains in the domain of well-resourced organizations with access to specialized computational infrastructure. GPT-3 maintains the same fundamental transformer architecture as GPT-2, using:
1. The same attention mechanism
2. Similar feed-forward network structure
3. Identical layer normalization approach
4. Comparable tokenization methods

**Scale Differences**  

The primary distinction lies in the massive scale increase:

## Layer Normalization in Deep Neural Networks  
In transformers like GPT, layer normalization is crucial for training stability across many layers, allowing effective learning of complex patterns without gradient issues. Layer Normalization stabilizes neural network training by standardizing the outputs (activations) of each layer to have:
* **Zero mean**: centered around 0. ($μ = 0$)
* **Unit variance**: spread of 1. ($σ^2 = 1$)

This addresses two critical problems in deep networks:
1. **Vanishing gradients:** Prevents gradients from becoming too small during backpropagation
2. **Exploding gradients:** Prevents gradients from becoming excessively large

**Benefits in Transformer Architectures**
1. **Training Stability:** Normalized activations prevent gradient issues
2. **Faster Convergence:** Models reach optimal solutions more quickly
3. **Consistent Learning:** Reliable training across different architectures
4. **Improved Generalization:** Better performance on unseen data

**This standardization process is mathematically represented as:**
* $LayerNorm(x) = (x - μ) / √(σ² + ε)$
* Where:
  * $x$ = input activation
  * $μ$ = mean of activations
  * $σ²$ = variance of activations
  * $ε$ = small constant (prevents division by zero)
* Operates on the last dimension: Typically the embedding dimension in transformers
* Uses epsilon ($ε$): A tiny constant (e.g., $1e-5$) added to prevent division by zero

**Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) and Batch Normalization (BatchNorm)**
Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) and Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) are both techniques to stabilize and accelerate neural network training, but they differ in how they normalize data.  

1. **Batch Normalization (BatchNorm)**
   * Normalizes across the batch dimension (for each feature, it computes mean/variance over all samples in the batch).
   * Requires large batches to compute reliable statistics.
   * Ideal for convolutional networks and tasks with fixed-size inputs (e.g., image classification).
     
2. **Layer Normalization (LayerNorm)**
   * Normalizes across the feature dimension (for each sample, it computes mean/variance across all features).
   * Independent of batch size — works even with batch size = 1.
   * Ideal for sequential data (e.g., NLP, transformers) and variable-length inputs.
  
**Example: The Scenario: Grading Students' Tests**  
Imagine we have a small class with 3 students, and they each took 4 exams. We can represent their scores in a table. In deep learning terms, this is a batch of 3 students (the batch size), each with 4 features (their scores).

* **Batch Normalization: "The Subject Expert":** looks at one subject at a time, across all students. It normalizes columns. It makes the distribution of scores for each subject consistent. For example, If a new student (Danny) comes in for just one test (a batch size of 1), the BatchNorm "expert" has no other students to compare him to.
* **Layer Normalization: "The Student Counselor":** LayerNorm looks at one student at a time, across all their subjects. It normalizes rows. It makes the distribution of scores for each student consistent. For example, If Danny comes in alone (batch size of 1), the LayerNorm "counselor" can still look at all his subjects, calculate his personal average and spread, and normalize his scores perfectly. It doesn't need other students.

## Implementing Feed-Forward Networks with GELU Activations
The dominance of the simple ReLU activation function has been challenged in the era of LLMs. To achieve higher performance, models now favor sophisticated alternatives like $GELU$ and $SwiGLU$. These functions introduce smooth, non-linear transitions (inspired by Gaussian and sigmoid gates, respectively) that are better suited for the complex patterns learned in deep language models. The GELU activation function can be implemented by the following function:  

<img width="692" height="74" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fe379a4-c331-45c1-8fdb-3738d76460c5" />

GELU's smooth gradient enables more precise parameter updates, facilitating better optimization than ReLU. Unlike ReLU's sharp, non-differentiable point at zero which can hinder training in deep networks. GELU produces small, non-zero outputs for negative inputs. This allows all neurons to contribute to learning, rather than having negative inputs be completely deactivated. The output of the $GELU$ and $ReLU$ can be as follow:

The **FeedForward module** is vital for a model's learning and generalization. It first projects inputs into a higher-dimensional space (e.g., 4x wider $768 → 3072$), applies a non-linear $GELU$ activation, then projects back down to the original dimension. This allows the model to learn more complex, richer feature representations within each token's context. Crucially, maintaining identical input and output dimensions enables the seamless stacking of multiple transformer blocks, making the overall architecture scalable and modular.
