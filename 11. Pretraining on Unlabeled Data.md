# Pretraining on Unlabeled Data
Pretraining is the foundational stage where a Large Language Model (LLM) learns the statistical patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning abilities of a language by predicting the next word in a vast corpus of text. This process is self-supervised; the data is unlabeled because the "label" for any given word is simply the next word in the sequence.

##  Evaluating Generative Text Models
Evaluating the quality of text generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) is a critical step in the development process. Generating text with a model like GPT is a three-step cycle:  
1. **Tokenization:** The input text is converted into a sequence of token IDs using a tokenizer (e.g., GPT-2's BPE tokenizer).
2. **Model Inference:** The sequence of token IDs is fed into the LLM. The model's final output is a tensor of logits for each position in the sequence. These logits represent scores for every token in the model's vocabulary, indicating the model's prediction for the next token.
3. **Decoding:** The logits are converted back into token IDs. This can be done deterministically (e.g., always choosing the token with the highest score, "greedy decoding") or stochastically (e.g., using temperature or top-k sampling to introduce creativity). Finally, the new token IDs are converted back into human-readable text by the tokenizer.

This process is repeated autoregressively: the newly generated token is appended to the input, and the cycle continues until a stopping condition is met (e.g., a maximum length or an end-of-sequence token is generated).

Once text is generated, we need ways to measure its quality. Basic evaluation methods include:  

1. **Loss-based Metrics (Intrinsic Evaluation):**
   * Cross-Entropy Loss / Perplexity: The most fundamental quantitative measure. It calculates how well the model's predicted probability distribution matches the actual distribution of words in a held-out test dataset.
   * Lower Perplexity indicates the model is more "confident" and accurate in its predictions. This is an automatic, inexpensive metric that is core to the training process but doesn't always perfectly correlate with human judgment of quality.
2. **Human Evaluation (Extrinsic Evaluation):** The gold standard for evaluation. Humans rate generated text based on criteria like:
   * Coherence: Does the text make sense and flow logically?
   * Fluency: Is the text grammatically correct and natural-sounding?
   * Relevance: Does the text stay on-topic and address the prompt?
   * Factual Accuracy: For non-fiction, is the information correct?
     
In summary, evaluation involves a combination of automatic metrics (like loss) to track progress during training and human-centric methods (inspection and scoring) to ultimately assess the usefulness and quality of the generated text.
